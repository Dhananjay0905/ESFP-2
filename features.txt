This application provides a sense of security to the users using this app.


In thisapplication, we have Save Our Soul (SOS) features. This feature enables the victim to
send an emergency message along with the current location to their guardians.


The second feature is about tracking the location of the users for their own safety
purpose. While tracking the location, we can even send the message to the guardians
whether we are reaching the destination or not. We have implemented this feature
with the help of the Geofence Library.


There is also a fake call feature in it where the user gets a fake call
screen on his/her smartphone and can escape any situation by making a false excuse.


The Safe/Unsafe feature is used to see the nearby locations and check whether
they are safe or unsafe for that time. Here, we are planning to make this feature more efficient
by also taking the data of severalcrimes occurring in a particular area and then defining
it as safe or unsafe for thattime. It will be in our future versions of the application.
